# Class-Gen

Class-Gen is a generation classification project majorly for 4 generations of people. 
* The Gen z
* The Gen x
* The Baby boomers
* The Millenials

This project is for fun and it is just to learn how fine-tuning pre-trained models, image augmentation and preprocessing works.
I decided to go ahead with this project because there's no exact solution for it yet and we just have to keep trying till the neural networks learn perfectly.

Once, a validation accuracy of 75% has been reached, I am going to deploy and release the web application, for people to play around and give feedback.

Here's what I have done so far:
 * Scraped the web for images of 4 generations.
 * Data cleaning and preprocessing.
 * Image Augmentation
 * Used inception v3 on the model(tried resnet too, but it hasn't worked this fine)
 * Downloaded the .pkl format of the model with 64% val accuracy
 
 Here are other ways you can contribute to this project.
 * Other type of pre-trained model - multimodal llm's might be a way to go
 * Working on this project using pytorch or other deep learning frameworks
 
 Please note that you can contribute in other ways too, just make sure to raise an issue before opening a pull request.
 
 # Tech skills required
 * Python.
 * Selenium.
 * Computer vision.
